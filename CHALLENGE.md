# Lorem Ipsum Search

Hi - thanks for taking the time to chat with us. Please find below a technical take-home challenge.

This project will be used as your technical assessment (no whiteboard coding in the interview), please be prepared to
discuss the decisions made and explain your thinking about the problem and tradeoffs you made. We ask that you craft a
small frontend application in React to demonstrate your skills. Please spend no more than 2 hours on the assignment.
Because of the time limit, you’ll need to make tradeoffs. Feel free to note them in a README or share them with us
however you like.

## Challenge

Write a simple React frontend app to integrate with the provided backend Search Service. It should be able to call the
service, and display the results as a minimum. You can then use your own skills and knowledge to make the front end a
joy to use.

You don’t have to make any changes to the backend code - and the README provided includes samples of how to interact
with the service.

You should fork this SearchService repository to a Git repository of your choosing, implement your frontend solution
and share your solution repository link with us.

### Requirements & Capabilities

- Weighting of the search result should be taken into consideration in how you display results.
- There is no guarantee of consistent results for repeated search terms.
- The source must live in a code repository with access to history of commits

### What we’ll be looking for:

- The front end is easy to use and functions correctly
- Clear, easy to read, maintainable code
- Complete documentation
- Reliability
- Performance
